# Atomic Commits After Task Completion

When you complete a task, create an atomic commit with a clear, descriptive message.

## Commit Guidelines

1. **One logical change per commit** - Each commit should represent a single, cohesive change
2. **Commit immediately after completing a task** - Don't bundle unrelated changes together
3. **Use conventional commit format**:
   ```
   <type>: <short description>
   
   <optional body explaining why>
   ```

## Commit Types

- `feat`: New feature or functionality
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `docs`: Documentation changes
- `style`: Formatting, whitespace (no code change)
- `chore`: Build, config, dependencies

## Examples

```bash
# ✅ GOOD - Atomic and descriptive
feat: add keyboard navigation to visual acuity test

Allow users to respond using arrow keys instead of buttons.
Improves accessibility and speeds up test completion.

# ✅ GOOD - Focused on one fix
fix: prevent duplicate answers during feedback delay

# ❌ BAD - Too vague
update stuff

# ❌ BAD - Multiple unrelated changes
fix bug and add feature and update tests
```

## Workflow

1. Complete the requested task
2. Stage only the files related to that specific change
3. Write a commit message that explains **what** changed and **why**
4. If the task involved multiple logical changes, create separate commits for each
